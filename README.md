# Yahoo-Finance-Web-Scraping
# For this project I used Python to scrape data from profile and holders pages of 6 major stocks
# I wrote a python script to scrape stock price movement in the US stock market of the above stcocks. (Seen in CARBONE_scraper_holder.py)
# I Wrote a python scripty to scrape the name, address details, details on key executives, description and corporate governance data of the same stocks. (Seen in CARBONE_scraper_profile.py)
# I also utilized web scraping techniques, specifically BeautifulSoup library, to parse HTML and extract relevant financial information.
# I then generated output files in JSON, CSV, and Excel formats for subsequent data wrangling and analysis.
# Said files are organized as such:
  # Holder Page: CARBONE_stock_holder_data.json, CARBONE_stock_holder_data.csv and CARBONE_stock_holder_data.xlsx
  # Profile Page: CARBONE_stock_profile_data.json, CARBONE_stock_profile_data.csv and CARBONE_stock_profile_data.xlsx
